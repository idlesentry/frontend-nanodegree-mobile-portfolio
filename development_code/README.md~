## Running the Page

Open index.html from the main directory and enjoy! Development code is located in the 'development_code' directory.

### Getting started

####Part 1: GULP

1. I installed npm and node.js in order to run GULP within the local directory.
2. I then installed 'gulp-uglify', 'gulp-minify-css', and 'gulp-minify-html' in order to minify all of the content for the site.
3. After this came 'gulp-rename' in order to add the prefix 'min.' to the beginning of the new files' names.
4. Deciding against this, I output the new files into the 'build' directory within 'development_code' and then moved them into the main directory as a workaround to avoid hassle of different filenames and directories in the github repo.
5. After this, I installed 'gulp-imagemin' in order to automatically compress all of the image files. I tweaked the directory name for images in the 'views' directory to 'img' (same as the main directory).

####Part 2: Optimize PageSpeed Score for index.html

1. Decided to asynchronously load 'analytics.js' and 'perfmatters.js' because none of the content was critical to the page loading correctly.
2. Decided to asynchronously load the google font used in the page with some script at the bottom. Source: https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader
3. Decided to defer loading of 'print.css' as the content wasn't critical to loading.

4. Translated 'style.css' into style tags in header, inlined 'hero' class styles into only div where it applied and put 'content' class into larger 'li' style tag.
